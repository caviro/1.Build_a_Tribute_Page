      <p>Madame Curie (1867-1934) is one of the most important scientific figures in history for her research and creative talent . She won two Nobel Prizes , one in Physics and one in Química1.</p>
      <p>She was Polish but in Warsaw there was no professional future for women, so she went to study mathematics and physics to Paris. There she met a physics professor named Pierre Curie. He was able to see more about her … a point of genius, mysterious capacity to reason, an investigador instinct (1).</p>
      <p>After marriage, they began working on a captivating subject, based on recent discoveries of Professor Becquerel: radiation emitted by uranium. Its exciting and overwhelming task lasted over 3 years and finally reached their goal: the discovery of two new elements, polonium and radio (1) . She read her doctoral thesis in 1903 and that same year they three received Nobel Prize in Physics: “In recognition of the extraordinary services rendered by their joint researches on the radiation phenomena discovered by Henri Becquerel” (2).</p>
      <p>In 1911 she again obtained the Nobel Prize in Chemistry: “In recognition of his services in the advancement of chemistry by the discovery of the elements radium and polonium , the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of this element” (3). Is the first person who gets it in two different disciplines, the other person who has obtained to date is Linus Pauling in Chemistry and Peace and we can still say that she could get in Medicine. In 1914 , when it launched the First World War, Marie Curie, with a mobile Roentgen rays apparatus and her knowledge of radiation, she made ​​an effective and tireless campaign (mobile radiography), offering surgeons scientific collaboration. It was also very important in the following years her contributions to radiotherapy (1).</p>
      <p>She was the first woman who played a professorship in France. She always had a fragile health but she began to have continued fevers even though she had no affection essential organ.

The bone marrow did not react because she was disturbed by a long accumulation of radioactivity” (1).</p>
